infinite image scroll

node.js was used to check data from fetch API, but it is not needed to run.
This app fetches data from flickr.com by using API requests.
Then it shows the recent pictures on screen and when mousing over, shows the authors registered name and the title given to the image if there is one.
On scroll down gets more images after a set time out of 1s.
